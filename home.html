                <h2>The Cry of Pugad Lawin</h2>
                <p>(August 23, 1896)

                    The Cry of Pugad Lawin was a significant event in Philippine history, 
                    marking the start of the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule. 
                    Led by Andrés Bonifacio, members of the Katipunan gathered in Pugad Lawin,
                    where they tore their cedulas (residence tax certificates) in defiance of Spanish colonial authorities. 
                    This act symbolized their rejection of Spanish rule and commitment to fighting for independence. 
                    The event is considered the official beginning of the armed struggle for Philippine independence, 
                    ultimately leading to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic in 1899.</p>

                <h2>The First Philippine Republic</h2>
                <p>(January 23, 1899)

                    The First Philippine Republic, also known as the Malolos Republic, was inaugurated on January 23, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan. 
                    It was the first democratic republic in Asia, with Emilio Aguinaldo as its first president. 
                    The Malolos Congress drafted the Malolos Constitution, which established a government with executive,
                    legislative, and judicial branches. However, the republic was short-lived, 
                    as it was soon overpowered by American forces during the Philippine-American War.</p>
