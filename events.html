                <h2>The Cry of Pugad Lawin</h2>
                <p>(August 23, 1896)
                    The Cry of Pugad Lawin was a significant event in Philippine history, marking the start of the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule. 
                    Led by Andrés Bonifacio, members of the Katipunan gathered in Pugad Lawin, where they tore their cedulas (residence tax certificates) in defiance of Spanish colonial authorities.
                    This act symbolized their rejection of Spanish rule and commitment to fighting for independence. The event is considered the official beginning of
                    the armed struggle for Philippine independence, ultimately leading to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic in 1899.</p>

                <h2>The First Philippine Republic</h2>
                <p>The First Philippine Republic, also known as the Malolos Republic, was inaugurated on January 23, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan. 
                    It was the first democratic republic in Asia, with Emilio Aguinaldo as its first president. 
                    The Malolos Congress drafted the Malolos Constitution, which established a government with executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
                    However, the republic was short-lived, as it was soon overpowered by American forces during the Philippine-American War.</p>

                <p>
                    The Battle of Mactan was a significant clash between the native warriors of Lapu-Lapu and the forces of
                    Ferdinand Magellan on April 27, 1521. Lapu-Lapu, the chieftain of Mactan, refused to submit to 
                    Spanish rule and led his warriors in battle against Magellan’s troops. The battle ended with Magellan’s death, 
                    marking the first recorded resistance against foreign colonization in the Philippines. 
                    Lapu-Lapu is now regarded as the first Filipino hero for his defiance against Spanish invaders.</p>
